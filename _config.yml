# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

The FoMo lectures is a series of seminars highlighting the work being done in Amsterdam around foundation 
models: large, highly re-usable machine learning models trained on great amounts of data. These include large 
language models like GPT and generative vision models like DALLEÂ·2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney.

The talks are held alternately at the UvA and VU, and feature speakers from a variety of domains. They are 
intended for a technical audience.
