# FoMo: Foundation models in Amsterdam

The FoMo lectures is a series of seminars highlighting the work being done in Amsterdam around _foundation models_: large, highly re-usable machine learning models trained on great amounts of data. These include large language models like GPT and generative vision models like DALLEÂ·2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney.

The talks are held alternately at the UvA and VU, and feature speakers from a variety of domains. They are intended for a technical audience.
